# Team 1810 CATATRONICS

Team 1810 CATATRONICS, previously known as Jaguar Robotics, was started at Mill Valley High School in 2006 with just a handful of students. It has since moved to Cedar Trails Exploration Center (CTEC) and has expanded to a team of over 60 students. This increase in numbers has allowed us to restructure our team and split it into two teams, Teams 1810 and 9316. 1810 is made up of Juniors and Seniors and Team 9316 is made up of Freshman and Sophmores. 1810 being best known for working and developing bots with PVC, has switched in the 2023 season to alternative materials due to the greater manufacturing capabilities supplied to us by the CTEC location.

# Team 9316 CUB-ATRONICS

Team 9316 CUB-ATRONICS was created in 2023 to be a sister team to Team 1810. Whereas Team 1810 is comprised of Juniors and Seniors from Mill Valley High School and Desoto High School, Team 9316 is made up of Freshman and Sophmores. We meet at Cedar Trails Exploration Center in Lenexa, Ks. Despite the team's lack of experience, we have still been successful in competition.
