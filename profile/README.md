# Team 1810 CATATRONICS

Team 1810 Catatronics, previously known as Jaguar Robotics, was started at Mill Valley High School in 2006 with just a handful of students. It has since moved to Cedar Trails Exploration Center (CTEC) and has expanded to a team of over 60 students. This increase in numbers has allowed us restructure our team and split into a *Junior Varsity* (Team 9316) and *Varsity* (Team 1810). The *Varsity team* is made up of Juniors and Seniors and the *JV team* is made up of Freshman and Sophmores. 1810 being best known for working and developing bots with PVC, have switched in the 2023 season to alternative materials due to the greater manufacturing capabilities supplied to us by the CTEC location.
